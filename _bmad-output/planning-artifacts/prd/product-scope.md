# Product Scope

This section defines what's in scope for MVP, what's deferred to future phases, and what's explicitly out of scope.

## MVP — Minimum Viable Product

**Must Have:**
- Overview page with stats dashboard
- Solo mode (full 17-step flow)
- Together mode with lobby, roles, and real-time sync
- Reflection system (rating, help flag, notes)
- Daily Prayer Report (send/receive messages)
- Optimistic UI with IndexedDB caching
- 5 Supabase tables with RLS

**Deferred from MVP:**
- Streak tracking (intentionally omitted to avoid pressure)
- Push notifications for partner activity
- Historical trend charts for reflections

## Growth Features (Post-MVP)

- Custom scripture sets (user-curated readings)
- Scheduled sessions ("Let's do this every Sunday at 8pm")
- Gentle nudges ("It's been a week — want to reconnect?")
- Reflection history with privacy controls
- Export/share prayer report to journal

## Vision (Future)

- Multiple activity types (Scripture Reading is first of many)
- Guided prompts for post-conflict repair conversations
- Integration with existing mood tracking (correlate moods with sessions)
- Couples devotional content partnerships

## Non-Goals

- **Not therapy** — just a structured spiritual connection activity
- **Not competitive** — no leaderboards, no "winning"
- **Not streak-obsessed** — missing days is not a failure
- **Not fixing people** — the goal is connection, not correction
