# Executive Summary

**Scripture Reading for Couples — A Responsive Reading (NKJV)** is a guided spiritual activity where couples read scripture together (synchronized real-time) or solo, with reflection tracking, help flags, and a "daily prayer report" summary. The activity consists of 17 scripture steps paired with couple-focused response prayers across themes of healing, forgiveness, confession, peace, words, and character.

**Why it exists:** A calm, "safe-to-be-honest" ritual for connection and repair. Helps couples soften toward each other, communicate better (especially after conflict), and build trust through repeated, gentle practice.

**MVP scope:** Solo mode (resumable with optimistic UI) + Together mode (lobby, Reader/Responder roles, synchronized phases, 3-second countdown). Reflection per step (1-5 rating, help flag, optional note). Daily Prayer Report (partner messages, shared reflections).

**Key non-goals:** No streaks (avoid pressure). No push notifications (keep calm). No shame UX ("Continue solo" not "Partner abandoned you"). Not therapy — just structured spiritual connection.
