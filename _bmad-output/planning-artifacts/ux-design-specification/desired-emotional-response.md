# Desired Emotional Response

## Primary Emotional Goals

| Moment | Primary Emotion | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Starting a session** | Safe & Unhurried | No pressure, no guilt — they chose this freely |
| **After choosing mode** | Relieved & Grounded | "Okay, we're doing something constructive" |
| **During the reading** | Present & Connected | Fully in the moment, aware of partner |
| **Bookmarking a verse** | Acknowledged | "This one matters to me" |
| **At the Daily Prayer Report** | Tender & Relieved | "We didn't solve everything, but we softened" |
| **Returning next time** | Welcomed & Gentle | Like returning to a familiar, comforting ritual |

**Differentiating Emotion:** Not productivity ("we completed 17 steps!") but **presence** ("we were actually together for a moment") and **relief** ("we can breathe again").

## Emotional Journey Mapping

| Stage | Discovery | Start | Mid-Session | End | Return |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|-----|--------|
| **Emotions** | Curious, Hopeful | Unhurried, Safe | Relieved, Present, Honest | Tender, Relieved, Grateful | Welcomed, Gentle, Ready |

**Relief Progression:**
- **Early:** "Okay, we're doing something constructive" (choosing mode)
- **Mid:** "We're reading together, on the same page" (during session)
- **End:** "We didn't solve everything, but we softened" (Daily Prayer Report)

**Error State Emotions:**
- Partner doesn't join → Neutral acceptance, not abandonment
- Network drops → Calm patience, not alarm
- Partner offline → Presence-aware waiting, not problem-focused

## Micro-Emotions

**Cultivate:**
- **Confidence** — Users always know what to do next
- **Trust** — Data is safe, sync works, partner is present
- **Belonging** — This is "our" ritual, personalized with partner names
- **Permission** — Honesty and struggle are welcomed, not exposed
- **Relief** — Tension releases progressively through the session

**Avoid:**
- **Guilt** — No streaks, no "you've been away" shaming
- **Pressure** — No notifications pushing completion
- **Exposure** — Private reflections, controlled sharing
- **Confusion** — Crystal clear phase transitions

## Design Implications

| Emotion | UX Approach |
|---------|-------------|
| **Safe & Unhurried** | No timers (except countdown). Generous transitions. |
| **Relieved & Grounded** | Calm confirmation when mode chosen. No "are you sure?" dialogs. |
| **Present & Connected** | Partner name visible. Partner position indicator. Synchronized moments. |
| **Honest & Unjudged** | Rating is neutral (1-5). Bookmarks are personal. Notes truly optional. |
| **Tender & Relieved** | Daily Prayer Report beautifully presented. Partner message revealed gently. |
| **Welcomed & Gentle** | Warm resume prompts. No accusatory language. |

**Subtle Delight Moments:**
- Countdown animation creates shared anticipation
- Partner's message revealed like receiving a gift
- Bookmarked verses highlighted at reflection time

## Emotional Design Principles

1. **Safety First** — When in doubt, choose the gentler, less pressuring option.

2. **Presence Over Performance** — Celebrate connection, not completion.

3. **Relief as Design Goal** — Each interaction should release tension, not add to it.

4. **Permission Without Expectation** — All vulnerability features are genuine invitations.

5. **Gentle Failures** — Error states use warm, neutral language. Never blame. Never alarm.

6. **Ritual, Not Task** — Use ritual language:
   - ✓ "Continue," "Reflect," "Close for now," "End for today"
   - ✗ "Submit," "Finish," "Done," "Complete"
