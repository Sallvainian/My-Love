# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ===================
#   pending:      Not yet started
#   in-progress:  Currently executing
#   completed:    Done
#   skipped:      Intentionally skipped
#   if-needed:    Run when circumstances require
#
# GATE DECISIONS: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED
#
# BROWNFIELD NOTES:
# =================
# - trace-baseline establishes BASELINE coverage (not net-new)
# - test-design-epic focuses on REGRESSION HOTSPOTS
# - atdd is PER-STORY (catch regressions early)
# - automate is PER-STORY (expand coverage immediately after dev)
# - test-review focuses on improving LEGACY test quality
# - trace tracks coverage IMPROVEMENT vs baseline
#
# PER-STORY CYCLE:
#   create-story (SM) → atdd (TEA) → dev-story (DEV) → code-review (DEV) → automate (TEA)
