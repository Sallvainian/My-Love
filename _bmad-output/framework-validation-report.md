## Recommendations

### 🎯 Priority: LOW - Documentation Cleanup

**Issue**: Documentation references knowledge base files that don't exist in project:
- `_bmad/bmm/testarch/knowledge/overview.md`
- `_bmad/bmm/testarch/knowledge/fixtures-composition.md`
- `_bmad/bmm/testarch/knowledge/data-factories.md`
- `_bmad/bmm/testarch/knowledge/network-first.md`

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Create these knowledge base files, OR
2. Update tests/README.md to remove non-existent references

**Impact**: Documentation only, no functional impact

### 🎯 Priority: LOW - Expand Helper Utilities

**Current State**: Basic helpers (waitFor, generateTestEmail, formatTestDate)

**Recommendation**: Consider adding:
- Selector helpers for common patterns
- Data transformation utilities
- Test data builders for complex scenarios

**Impact**: Would improve test maintainability and reduce duplication

### 🎯 Priority: LOW - Page Objects (Optional)

**Current State**: Tests use direct selectors (acceptable pattern)

**Consideration**: For complex pages with many interactions, page objects could:
- Reduce selector duplication
- Improve maintainability
- Provide better abstraction

**Note**: Current approach is valid and works well. Only add page objects if tests become difficult to maintain.
