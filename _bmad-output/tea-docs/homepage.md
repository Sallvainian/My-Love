## What is TEA?

TEA (Test Engineering Architect) functions as a BMAD module addressing testing strategy and automation. The system delivers nine workflows spanning learning, setup, design, automation, review, and release gates.

**Key Features:**
- **Workflow-Driven**: Multiple workflows covering day-to-day test architect activities
- **Consistent Outputs**: "Knowledge-base guidance keeps standards consistent, no matter the agent being used"
- **Risk-Based**: P0-P3 prioritization using probability x impact calculation
- **Release Gates**: "Evidence-backed go/no-go decisions with traceability"
