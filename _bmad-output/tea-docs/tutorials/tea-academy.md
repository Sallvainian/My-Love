# TEA Academy: Learn Testing with Test Architect

## Overview

TEA Academy is an interactive learning program offering 7 structured sessions designed to teach testing progressively. As stated, it "teaches progressively: Build knowledge session by session" and "validates understanding: Quiz after each session (>=70% to pass)."

## Key Features

**Progressive Learning Structure**
- 7 self-paced sessions spanning 1-2 weeks
- Role-based customization (QA Engineers, Developers, Tech Leads, VPs/Managers)
- Automatic progress tracking with resume capability
- Certificate awarded upon completion of all sessions

## The 7 Sessions

1. **Quick Start (30 min)** - TEA fundamentals and 9 workflows overview
2. **Core Concepts (45 min)** - Testing as engineering, risk-based testing, quality principles
3. **Architecture & Patterns (60 min)** - Fixture composition, network-first patterns, step-file architecture
4. **Test Design (60 min)** - Coverage planning and test level framework
5. **ATDD & Automate (60 min)** - TDD patterns and API testing approaches
6. **Quality & Trace (45 min)** - Test review, quality scoring, traceability
7. **Advanced Patterns (Ongoing)** - 34 knowledge fragments for specialized topics

## Getting Started

Users begin by running `tea` or `teach-me-testing` commands, completing a 4-question assessment, then selecting sessions based on experience level. Each session includes concept instruction, a 3-question quiz, and automatic note generation.

## Progress Management

All artifacts save to dedicated directories with per-user progress files, enabling individual team members to track advancement independently while maintaining centralized documentation.
