# TEA Academy: Learning Testing Through Structured Sessions

## Overview

The TEA Academy provides a comprehensive learning program through the `teach-me-testing` workflow. This self-paced training spans 7 progressive sessions designed to build testing expertise over 1-2 weeks.

## Key Program Structure

**Seven Sessions:**
1. Quick Start (30 min) - TEA fundamentals and engagement models
2. Core Concepts (45 min) - Risk-based testing and quality principles
3. Architecture & Patterns (60 min) - Fixture composition and network-first approaches
4. Test Design (60 min) - Risk assessment and coverage planning
5. ATDD & Automate (60 min) - Test-driven development methodology
6. Quality & Trace (45 min) - Test review dimensions and traceability
7. Advanced Patterns (ongoing) - 34 knowledge fragments for specialized topics

## How It Works

Users begin by running `tea` then selecting the `teach-me-testing` workflow. An initial assessment gathers information about role (QA, Dev, Lead, VP), experience level, and learning goals. The program then presents a menu showing completion status for each session.

## Progress Tracking

The system automatically saves progress to:
- Progress file: `{test_artifacts}/teaching-progress/{your-name}-tea-progress.yaml`
- Session notes: `{test_artifacts}/tea-academy/{your-name}/session-{N}-notes.md`
- Completion certificate upon finishing all sessions

## Target Audiences

**Beginners** should follow sessions 1-7 sequentially. **Intermediate learners** can accelerate through familiar sessions 1-2. **Experienced practitioners** can jump directly to sessions 3-4 and 7 for advanced patterns.

## Session Flow Pattern

Each session includes teaching content adapted to the learner's role, followed by a 3-question quiz requiring 70% passage, automatic note generation, progress saving, and return to the menu for navigation.
