# Change Log

- **2026-01-31:** Implemented Story 1.5 Accessibility Foundations — created centralized `useMotionConfig` hook, added keyboard focus-visible rings to all interactive elements, implemented screen reader announcer regions with semantic-change-only announcements, added programmatic focus management on transitions, implemented dialog focus trap with focus restoration, fixed WCAG AA contrast ratios (purple-400 to purple-600), added error icons and disabled reason text for color independence, changed ScriptureOverview to semantic `<main>` element, added `aria-current="step"` to progress indicator. 32 new tests added, 456 total tests pass with zero regressions.
- **2026-02-01 (Code Review):** Fixed 3 bugs found during adversarial review: (1) focus management on sub-view transitions was broken due to shared-ref race condition between announcement and focus effects — combined into single effects; (2) same race condition on step change focus management — combined into single effect; (3) completion announcement/focus called setState from render body via requestAnimationFrame — moved to useEffect. Added 3 new focus management tests verifying actual focus movement (Back to Verse after View Response, verse heading after Back to Verse, verse heading after step advancement). 459 total tests pass.
