# Archived E2E Tests

This directory contains test files that have been archived (removed from active test suite).

## Files

### Sprint 1 Placeholder Tests (Moved 2026-02-06)

These files were created as placeholders during Sprint 1 but were never implemented. They contain only `test.skip()` stubs and provide zero coverage value.

- **home-view.spec.ts** - 4 skipped tests for home page
- **data-sync.spec.ts** - 2 skipped tests for offline data sync
- **bottom-nav.spec.ts** - 6 skipped tests for bottom navigation

**Reason for archiving:** Per TEA framework improvement plan Phase 1.2, these stub files inflate apparent test coverage and add noise to the test suite without providing any actual validation.

**Status:** These features may be tested in the future when requirements are defined. Until then, keeping them in the active test suite is misleading.

### Epic 1 Validation (Previously Archived)

- **epic-1-validation.spec.ts** - Original Epic 1 comprehensive validation suite
