# Playwright Test Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.test to customize test execution locally
# .env.test is gitignored and will not be committed

# Base URL for the application under test
# Should match the Vite dev server with base path configuration
# Default: http://localhost:5173/My-Love/
BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173/My-Love/

# Test timeout in milliseconds
# Maximum time a single test can run before failing
# Default: 30000 (30 seconds - appropriate for PWA operations)
TEST_TIMEOUT=30000

# Headless browser mode
# Set to false to see the browser window during test execution
# Useful for debugging test failures
# Default: true (headless mode for CI and local development)
HEADLESS=true

# Slow motion delay in milliseconds
# Adds a delay between test actions for easier visual debugging
# Set to 0 for normal speed execution
# Recommended: 100-500 for debugging, 0 for normal runs
# Default: 0 (no slow motion)
SLOW_MO=0

# CI environment detection
# Automatically set by GitHub Actions and other CI systems
# Do not manually set this variable
# CI=true

# E2E Test Credentials (required for Playwright tests)
# Create a test user in Supabase and set these values in .env.test
VITE_TEST_USER_EMAIL=test@example.com
VITE_TEST_USER_PASSWORD=secure-test-password-123

# Test user must:
# 1. Exist in Supabase Auth
# 2. Have completed onboarding (display_name set)
# 3. Have a partner relationship (for full test coverage)

# IMPORTANT: Before running E2E tests
# - Ensure no other dev servers are running on port 5173
# - Check with: lsof -i :5173
# - Kill conflicting servers: pkill -f "vite.*5173"
