# What is My Love?

**My Love** is a full-featured Progressive Web Application (PWA) for couples to share daily love messages, track moods, store photo memories, and interact with each other in real-time. It evolved from a simple message display app to a comprehensive relationship companion with cloud synchronization via Supabase.

Think of it as a digital relationship journal that combines daily affirmations, emotional tracking, photo memories, and playful partner interactions - all with offline-first architecture and real-time sync.
