# Overview

My Love PWA uses **Zustand** for state management with a slice-based architecture. The store is composed of feature-specific slices that are merged into a single store with automatic LocalStorage persistence.

## Key Features

- **Slice-Based Architecture**: Each feature has its own isolated slice
- **Automatic Persistence**: LocalStorage middleware saves state automatically
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with inferred types
- **React 19 Compatible**: Works with React's latest features
- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Simple API without Redux complexity
