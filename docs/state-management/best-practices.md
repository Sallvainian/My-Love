# Best Practices

## 1. Keep Slices Focused

Each slice handles one domain (messages, photos, mood, etc.)

## 2. Use Immutable Updates

All state updates create new object references

## 3. Persist Essential Data Only

Don't persist loading states, UI state, or derived data

## 4. Optimize Selectors

Use shallow comparison and memoization where appropriate

## 5. Handle Async Actions Properly

Track loading/error states, handle failures gracefully

## 6. Type Everything

Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors
