# My-Love PWA - Environment Configuration
# ============================================
# This is a TEMPLATE showing the structure of required environment variables.
#
# NOTE: The actual .env file is encrypted using dotenvx and IS committed to git.
# Encrypted .env files are safe to commit - only .env.keys must stay secret.
#
# To add/modify values:
# 1. Edit the encrypted .env with decryption: dotenvx decrypt
# 2. Make your changes
# 3. Re-encrypt: dotenvx encrypt

# Supabase Backend Configuration (Story 0.2)
# ============================================
# Supabase provides backend services: Database, Auth, Realtime, Storage
# Get these values from: Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API
# https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/settings/api

# Supabase Project URL
# Format: https://[project-id].supabase.co
# Example: https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co
# Required for all Supabase API calls (database, auth, storage, realtime)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co

# Supabase Anonymous Key (Public/Publishable Key)
# This key is SAFE for public exposure in client-side code
# Data access is protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the database
# Used for: Client authentication, database queries (with RLS), file uploads
# Get from: Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API → anon/public key
# Note: NEVER use the service_role key in client code - it bypasses RLS
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here

# ============================================
# Authentication Configuration (Story 6.7)
# ============================================
# The app uses email/password authentication. Users sign in with their credentials.
# Partner detection is automatic - the app finds the other user in the database.
#
# For production: Create user accounts in Supabase Auth dashboard
# See README.md for detailed setup instructions

# ============================================
# E2E Testing Configuration (Optional)
# ============================================
# Test user credentials for end-to-end tests
# Create a test user in Supabase Auth with these credentials for E2E tests to pass
# Without these, authentication-related E2E tests will be skipped
#
# Setup instructions:
# 1. Run: node scripts/setup-test-users.js (creates both test users automatically)
# 2. Or manually create users via Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
# 3. For CI, add these as GitHub repository secrets
