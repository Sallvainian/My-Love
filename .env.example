# Supabase Backend Configuration (Epic 6)
# ============================================
# Supabase project for mood tracking, interactions, and real-time sync
# Get these values from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/settings/api

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here

# ============================================
# Authentication Configuration (Story 6.7)
# ============================================
# The app uses email/password authentication. Users sign in with their credentials.
# Partner detection is automatic - the app finds the other user in the database.
#
# For production: Create user accounts in Supabase Auth dashboard
# See README.md for detailed setup instructions

# ============================================
# E2E Testing Configuration (Optional)
# ============================================
# Test user credentials for end-to-end tests
# Create a test user in Supabase Auth with these credentials for E2E tests to pass

VITE_TEST_USER_EMAIL=test@example.com
VITE_TEST_USER_PASSWORD=testpassword123

# ============================================
# Development Notes
# ============================================
# 1. The ANON_KEY is safe to use client-side (it's for public API access)
# 2. Row Level Security (RLS) policies protect data at the database level
# 3. Authentication is handled via Supabase Auth (Google OAuth + Email/Password)
# 4. Session persistence is automatic via localStorage (Supabase SDK)
# 5. Partner relationships managed through database (partner_id column in users table)
# 6. For local development, copy this file to .env and add your Supabase credentials
# 7. For E2E tests, create a test user with credentials matching VITE_TEST_USER_*
# 8. For production deployment, set VITE_SUPABASE_* as GitHub Secrets
