# Get these values from: Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API
# https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/settings/api

# Supabase Anonymous Key (Public/Publishable Key)
# This key is SAFE for public exposure in client-side code
# Data access is protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the database
# Used for: Client authentication, database queries (with RLS), file uploads
# Get from: Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API → anon/public key
# Note: NEVER use the service_role key in client code - it bypasses RLS
